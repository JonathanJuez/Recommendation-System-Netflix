# Recommendation-System-Netflix
NPL recommendation system by analyzing the similarity of series descriptions on Netï¬‚ix

This dataset consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019.To start the exploratory analysis of the data, we will proceed to implement user stories using Jira in order to take control in the tasks to be performed to carry out this project. 

The project consists of implementing a recommendation system by implementing unsupervised learning models such as K-Means, MiniBatch K-means, and DBSCAN, in turn, dimension reduction techniques of qualitative and quantitative variables are implemented, in order to find the clusters with the best results to develop the recommendation system. 

Tools: 
- *Jira*
- *Pandas/numpy,scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
- *PCA / MCA*
- *Unsupervised learning models such as K-Means, MiniBatch K-means, and DBSCAN*
